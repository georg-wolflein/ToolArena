description: >
  Optimize answers to multiple-choice medical questions using TextGrad.
  Each question is improved at test-time through textual gradients,
  guided by an objective (e.g. "Make the answer concise and accurate"). 
# Description of the task. This should be 1-3 sentences in length, explaining to the LLM what this tool should do.
arguments:
  # Arguments of the task. The key is the name of the argument and the value is a dictionary with the keys "description" and "type".
  # For example, the following 3 lines define an argument "input_image" with a description "Path to the input image" and a type "str".
  csv_path:
    description: "Path to a CSV file containing columns: 'index', 'question', 'objective'"
    type: str
  backward_engine:
    description: The model used to compute textual gradients (e.g., 'gpt-4o')
    type: str
  forward_engine:
    description: The model used to generate initial zero-shot answers (e.g., 'gpt-3.5-turbo')
    type: str
  # You may define more arguments as needed...
returns:
  # Define the outputs of the task here, in the same way as the arguments are defined.
  # Here, we just define a single output "features", but you may define more as needed.
  optimized_answers:
    description: "A list of optimized answers, each ending with 'Answer: $LETTER'"
    type: list
example:
  # Below, we define an example invocation of the task, i.e. a specific input to the tool.
  # This section is required, and it consists of "arguments" and "mount" (see below).
  arguments:
    # For each input argument, specify the value to be used for the example invocation.
    csv_path: /mount/input/sample_0.csv
    backward_engine: gpt-4o
    forward_engine: gpt-3.5-turbo
  mount:
    # In this section, you can specify files or folders that should be mounted from the data directory to the container (at "/mount/input" in the container).
    # The format is key: value, where key is the name of the file or folder and value is the path to the file or folder in the data directory.
    # For example, the following line mounts the file "TUM-TCGA-ACRLPPQE.tif" from the data directory to the container, placing it at the path "/mount/input/TUM-TCGA-ACRLPPQE.tif" in the container.
    sample_0.csv: sample_0.csv
test_invocations:
  # Below, we define test invocations for the task.
  # Each test invocation is a dictionary with the keys "arguments" and "mount", like the example invocation above.
  # The test invocations can be used in the unit tests to check that the task is working as expected.
  # Below, we define 3 test invocations for the task, named "tif", "png", and "jpg". 
  # It is recommended that you define at least 3 test invocations (of course, you can choose any names you want).
