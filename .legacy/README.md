This directory contains the task definitions and data for the ToolArena benchmark.

This folder organized as follows:
- [`tasks/`](tasks/): contains the task definitions
- [`data/`](data/): contains the data for the benchmark
- [`tests/`](tests/): contains the unit tests for the benchmark
- [`papers.yaml`](papers.yaml): contains the papers used in the benchmark
- [`papers.bib`](papers.bib): contains the bibtex entries for the papers

## Task definitions ([`tasks/`](tasks/))

Tasks are defined in the [`tasks/`](tasks/) directory. Each task is defined in a separate YAML file, e.g. the task `medsam_inference` is defined in the file [`tasks/medsam_inference.yaml`](tasks/medsam_inference.yaml).

Tasks are defined using the following structure:

```yaml
name: stamp_train_classification_model  # name of the task, must correspond to the filename
repo:
  name: STAMP
  url: "https://github.com/KatherLab/STAMP"
  branch: v1
  env: # allows you to specify environment variables that are needed to install the repository or execute the task
    HF_TOKEN: ${env:HF_TOKEN}
papers: [elnahhas2024stamp]  # list of papers that are relevant to the task (must correspond to paper(s) defined in `metadata.yaml`)
category: pathology  # category of the task, e.g. "pathology", "radiology", etc.
description: >-  # description of the task for the LLM
  Train a model for biomarker classification. You will be supplied with the path to the folder containing the whole slide images, alongside a path to a CSV file containing the training labels.
arguments:  # keyword arguments for the task
  slide_dir:  # name of the argument
    description:  Path to the folder containing the whole slide images.  # description of the argument for the LLM
    type: str  # type of the argument, e.g. str, int, bool, etc.
  clini_table:
    description: Path to the CSV file containing the clinical data.
    type: str
  slide_table:
    description: Path to the CSV file containing the slide metadata.
    type: str
  target_column:
    description: The name of the column in the clinical data that contains the target labels.
    type: str
  trained_model_path:
    description: Path to the *.pkl file where the trained model should be saved by this function.
    type: str
returns:  # this section defines the return values of the task, each return value has a name, description and type
  num_params:
    description: The number of parameters in the trained model.
    type: int
example:  # this section defines one example of how to call the task which will be used by the agent to evaluate the proposed code and refine it
  arguments:  # keyword arguments for the example (each argument must correspond to an argument defined in the `arguments` section)

## Data ([`data/`](data/))

The data folder contains the data for the benchmark.
Many of the files are large, so they are not included in the repository.
The [`data/download.sh`](data/download.sh) script can be used to download some of the missing files.
The remaining files should be downloaded according to the instructions in the [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) file.

## Papers ([`papers/`](papers/))

The papers folder contains the papers for the benchmark.
Each paper is provided in txt format, e.g. the paper `MedSAM` is provided in the file [`papers/MedSAM.txt`](papers/MedSAM.txt).

## Tests ([`tests/`](tests/))

The tests folder contains the unit tests for the benchmark.
Each tool has a test file, e.g. the test for the tool `uni_extract_features` is defined in the file [`tests/test_uni_extract_features.py`](tests/test_uni_extract_features.py).

At the top of each test file, we call the `initialize()` function:
```python
from tests.utils import initialize

initialize()
```
This function registers a pytest fixture named `tool` for the tool itself, e.g. `uni_extract_features`. It also registers a fixture for each invocation of the tool defined in the YAML file in the `test_invocations` section, e.g. `kather100k_muc`.

Loosely speaking, calling the `initialize()` function is equivalent to the following code:
```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def tool(name: str):
    def wrapper(invocation: ToolInvocation) -> ToolRunResult:
        return run_tool(name, arguments=invocation.arguments, mounts=invocation.mount)

    return wrapper

@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def kather100k_muc(tool: ToolFixture):
    return tool("kather100k_muc")
```
